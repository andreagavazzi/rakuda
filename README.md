# Rakuda | Echo

Echo is an integrated robotic platform purpose-built for data collection, operational training, and experimentation in human-centered environments.

Equipped with **17 degrees of freedom**, Echo delivers a human-like range of motion, making it ideal for complex manipulation tasks. Its **dual 7-DOF arms**, powered by Dynamixel smart actuators, enable dexterous, anthropomorphic interaction with objects and tools. A motorized head with stereo vision provides precise 3D perception of the environment, supporting tasks that require spatial awareness, recognition, and responsive behavior.

The head unit, featuring **stereo cameras and a 6-microphone directional array**, draws inspiration from the design of Apptronik’s Apollo robot. This configuration allows Echo to localize sound sources and respond to spoken input with high spatial and acoustic accuracy, enhancing its capabilities in dynamic and noisy environments.

Echo’s mechanical structure is composed of **3D-printed components**, enabling rapid iteration, modular customization, and a lightweight yet durable form factor.

At its core, Echo runs on the **Jetson Orin**, executing local AI workloads such as computer vision, speech synthesis, and real-time multimodal interaction. Fully compatible with **ROS 2**, the platform integrates seamlessly with conversational APIs and embodied AI agents, making it suitable for advanced human-robot interaction, cognitive research, and educational robotics.

Echo is more than just a robot—it’s a synthetic companion designed to observe, learn, and engage. Its architecture bridges physical embodiment with contextual intelligence, offering researchers and developers a flexible tool for exploring the future of collaborative robotics and embodied cognition.
