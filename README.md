# Rakuda

Rakuda | Echo is an integrated robotic platform purpose-built for data collection, operational training, and experimentation in human-centered environments.

Equipped with 17 degrees of freedom, Echo delivers a human-like range of motion, making it ideal for complex manipulation tasks. Its dual 7-DOF arms are designed for dexterous, anthropomorphic interaction with objects and tools, while a motorized head with stereo vision enables accurate 3D perception of its surroundings—essential for navigation, recognition, and responsive behavior.

At its core, Echo is optimized for embedded intelligence. Powered by the Jetson Orin Nano, it runs local AI models for visual processing, speech synthesis, and real-time interaction. Fully integrated with ROS 2, the platform supports conversational APIs and multimodal perception, making it suitable for cognitive agent development, embodied AI research, and advanced human-robot interaction scenarios.

Echo is more than just a robot—it’s a synthetic companion designed to observe, learn, and engage. Its architecture bridges physical embodiment with contextual intelligence, offering researchers and developers a flexible tool for studying embodied cognition, collaborative robotics, and machine learning in dynamic settings.
